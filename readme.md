# Snake Game

A classic Snake Game implemented using Python's `pygame` library. Control the snake, eat food, and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or your own body. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
  - **Left Arrow**: Move left
  - **Right Arrow**: Move right
  - **Up Arrow**: Move up
  - **Down Arrow**: Move down
- The goal is to eat the red food to grow the snake. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the window or itself.
